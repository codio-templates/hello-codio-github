The first step to using GitHub in Codio is connecting your Codio and Github accounts. You only have to do this once.

You do this by (feel free to open another Codio tab to follow along):

1. Clicking on your user name in the bottom left of the main menu. 

1. Go to the **Applications** tab so your screen looks like the screen shot below.

1. For SSH connections, you will also need to press the **Upload public key** button so Codio and Github exchange keys.
